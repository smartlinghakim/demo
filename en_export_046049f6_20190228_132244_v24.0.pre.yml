      po_customization: 
        in_no_time_your: "In no time, your purchase order can change from the default look on the left to one on the right."
        to_customize_your_purchase: "To customize your purchase order template, go to the Setup menu and choose the \"PO Customization\" option.  From there, you will be able to modify key elements like the company name, company contact, logo and boilerplate.  For more extensive customization, you will download the Coupa standard template which is your default look and feel.  Using any editor, you can modify that template to expose new information on the order, hide other information, etc.  When you're done, simply upload your modified template.  We'll check for errors and then you can preview how your new template will look.  "
        your_purchase_order_is: "Your purchase order is entirely customizable to communicate both your company's brand and the information that needs to go to your suppliers.  From your company's logo to the boilerplate information and everywhere in between, you can easily customize your purchase order look with nothing more than simple HTML knowledge."
      price_comparisons: 
        price_comparisons_enable_your: "Price comparisons enable your users to search for the best price on the items they are ordering. Once an item is in their cart they can click the icon for a price comparison service to be brought to that site with their item name in the search."
        to_add_more_sites: "To add more sites than Google, NexTag, Shopping.com and Amazon, click the plus icon. Then type in the URL for the site, for example http://price.google.com. Adding $SEARCHKEY$ allows Coupa to insert the item description directly into the URL. Each site will be different, try searching on the site you want to add and see how it adds the search to the URL. You should upload a 16 by 16 pixel image that will let the user know which services are available."
        to_configure_price_comparisons: "To configure Price Comparisons go to the Setup tab and click Price Comparisons. On the page you can select if you want your users to be able to do price comparisons. Otherwise if you check the Buyers Only checkbox next to each price comparison service only users with a buyer role will see the price comparisons."
      punchout_sites_and_xml_ordering: 
        its_always_a_good: "It's always a good idea to test out Punchout and cXML ordering with each new supplier."
        many_large_suppliers_support: "Many large suppliers support Punchout with your Coupa system.   If certain of your suppliers do, ask them for a few pieces of information. That information is typically their Punchout URL, shared secret, buyer domain and buyer identity.  The supplier might also give you specific supplier domain and supplier identity credentials.  With the information, you create Punchout connections through the Punchout sites link in the Administration menu.  All Punchout sites require a %{action}."
        punchout_is_a_electronic: "Punchout is a electronic business XML standard which allows your users to shop at a supplier's website, pick certain items from their catalog and then return to Coupa with those items in their Coupa cart.  The biggest benefit is that your users get access to the supplier's content and up-to-date pricing and you don't have to maintain it."
        to_further_electronic_integration: "To further electronic integration, you can send purchase orders to suppliers via the cXML standard.  As opposed to emailing your purchase orders, these orders can go directly into their order management systems.  You'll need to talk to your supplier and gather similar information as the Punchout.  Once gathered, you edit the supplier, change the PO transmission method to cXML and fill out the required information."
      receiving: 
        its_a_good_practice: "It's a good practice to create receipts for goods and services that you buy.  By doing so, you have a record of what was has come in and what is outstanding."
        the_person_who_creates: "The person who creates the order can mark the items as received.  If you navigate into the My Account page, you will see all past requisitions.  Click the \"truck\" icon to initiate a receipt.  Enter the quantity you received and submit."
        there_are_2_ways: "There are 2 ways to create receipts in Coupa."
        you_have_a_person: "You have a person or group of people that do all the receiving, often called central receiving. The receiving group can view orders across the company and enter in the appropriate receipts.  When the receiving group creates a receipt, the employee who submitted the order gets notified that his or her package has arrived.  The receiving group can also %{action}, mark items with asset tags, record serial numbers and other advanced receiving features."
      rfqs: 
        perhaps_you_need_to: "Perhaps you need to get a new phone system or get 30 new fire extinguishers.  You may want to get competitive bids for these requirements.  Coupa RFQs, also known as Request for Quotes, allow you to send your requirements to vendors.  Vendors receive your requirements via email and can send back their bids.  Once vendor bids are entered, you can easily do one-time or repetitive buys off of the winning bid and the system tracks that the events were related."
        to_use_coupa_rfqs: "To use Coupa RFQs, you start by identifying the items or services that you need.  Enter in some basic information about the RFQ, such as what date you need the suppliers to respond, pick your vendors and issue the RFQ.  You can even create a questionnaire, very similar to %{action} questionnaires, that ask a series of questions to participating vendors.   Your vendor list can include existing suppliers and ones that you haven't done business with before."
